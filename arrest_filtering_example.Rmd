library(sf)
library(lubridate)
```
Read the file

Filter for just resisting arrest

```{r}
arrests_resist <- arrests %>%
  filter(pd_desc == "RESISTING ARREST")
```

Filter for just summer 2020

```{r}
arrests_resist_summer2020 <- arrests_resist %>%
  mutate(year = year(arrest_date)) %>%
  mutate(month = month(arrest_date)) %>%
  filter(year == 2020 &
           month > 4 &
           month < 9)
```

save as a much smaller geojson

```{r}
st_write(arrests_resist_summer2020, dsn="summer_NYC_resisting_arrest.geojson")
```
